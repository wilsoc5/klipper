The Klippy host code has some tools to help in debugging.

Translating gcode files to micro-controller commands
====================================================

The Klippy host code can run in a batch mode to produce the low-level
micro-controller commands associated with a gcode file. Inspecting
these low-level commands is useful when trying to understand the
actions of the low-level hardware. It can also be useful to compare
the difference in micro-controller commands after a code change.

To run Klippy in this batch mode, there is a one time step necessary
to generate the micro-controller "data dictionary". This is done by
compiling the micro-controller code to obtain the **out/klipper.dict**
file:

```
make menuconfig
make
```

Once the above is done it is possible to run Klipper in batch mode
(see [installation](Installation.md) for the steps necessary to build
the python virtual environment and a printer.cfg file):

```
~/klippy-env/bin/python ./klippy/klippy.py ~/printer.cfg -i test.gcode -o test.serial -v -d out/klipper.dict
```

The above will produce a file **test.serial** with the binary serial
output. This output can be translated to readable text with:

```
~/klippy-env/bin/python ./klippy/parsedump.py out/klipper.dict test.serial > test.txt
```

The resulting file **test.txt** contains a human readable list of
micro-controller commands.

The batch mode disables certain response / request commands in order
to function. As a result, there will be some differences between
actual commands and the above output. The generated data is useful for
testing and inspection; it is not useful for sending to a real
micro-controller.

Testing with simulavr
=====================

The [simulavr](http://www.nongnu.org/simulavr/) tool enables one to
simulate an Atmel ATmega micro-controller. This section describes how
one can run test gcode files through simulavr. It is recommended to
run this on a desktop class machine (not a Raspberry Pi) as it does
require significant cpu to run efficiently.

To use simulavr, download the simulavr package and compile with python
support:

```
git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/simulavr.git
cd simulavr
./bootstrap
./configure --enable-python
make
```

Note that the build system may need to have some packages (such as
swig) installed in order to build the python module. Make sure the
file **src/python/_pysimulavr.so** is present after the above
compilation.

To compile Klipper for use in simulavr, run:

```
cd /patch/to/klipper
make menuconfig
```

and compile the micro-controller software for an AVR atmega644p, set
the MCU frequency to 20Mhz, and select SIMULAVR software emulation
support. Then one can compile Klipper (run `make`) and then start the
simulation with:

```
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/simulavr/src/python/ ./scripts/avrsim.py -m atmega644 -s 20000000 -b 250000 out/klipper.elf
```

Then, with simulavr running in another window, one can run the
following to read gcode from a file (eg, "test.gcode"), process it
with Klippy, and send it to Klipper running in simulavr (see
[installation](Installation.md) for the steps necessary to build the
python virtual environment):

```
~/klippy-env/bin/python ./klippy/klippy.py config/avrsim.cfg -i test.gcode -v
```

Using simulavr with gtkwave
---------------------------

One useful feature of simulavr is its ability to create signal wave
generation files with the exact timing of events. To do this, follow
the directions above, but run avrsim.py with a command-line like the
following:

```
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/simulavr/src/python/ ./scripts/avrsim.py -m atmega644 -s 20000000 -b 250000 out/klipper.elf -t PORTA.PORT,PORTC.PORT
```

The above would create a file **avrsim.vcd** with information on each
change to the GPIOs on PORTA and PORTB. This could then be viewed
using gtkwave with:

```
gtkwave avrsim.vcd
```

Manually sending commands to the micro-controller
=================================================

Normally, the host klippy.py process would be used to translate gcode
commands to Klipper micro-controller commands. However, it's also
possible to manually send these MCU commands (functions marked with
the DECL_COMMAND() macro in the Klipper source code). To do so, run:

```
~/klippy-env/bin/python ./klippy/console.py /tmp/pseudoserial 250000
```

See the "HELP" command within the tool for more information on its
functionality.

Generating load graphs
======================

The Klippy log file (/tmp/klippy.log) stores statistics on bandwidth,
micro-controller load, and host buffer load. It can be useful to graph
these statistics after a print.

To generate a graph, a one time step is necessary to install the
"matplotlib" package:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
```

Then graphs can be produced with:

```
~/klipper/scripts/graphstats.py /tmp/klippy.log loadgraph.png
```

One can then view the resulting **loadgraph.png** file.

Extracting information from the klippy.log file
===============================================

The Klippy log file (/tmp/klippy.log) also contains debugging
information. There is a logextract.py script that may be useful when
analyzing a micro-controller shutdown or similar problem. It is
typically run with something like:

```
mkdir work_directory
cd work_directory
cp /tmp/klippy.log .
~/klipper/scripts/logextract.py ./klippy.log
```

The script will extract the printer config file and will extract MCU
shutdown information. The information dumps from an MCU shutdown (if
present) will be reordered by timestamp to assist in diagnosing cause
and effect scenarios.

Micro-controller Benchmarks
===========================

This section describes the mechanism used to generate the Klipper
micro-controller step rate benchmarks.

The primary goal of the benchmarks is to provide a consistent
mechanism for measuring the impact of coding changes within the
software. A secondary goal is to provide high-level metrics for
comparing the performance between chips and between software
platforms.

The step rate benchmark is designed to find the maximum stepping rate
that the hardware and software can reach. This benchmark stepping rate
is not achievable in day-to-day use as Klipper needs to perform other
tasks (eg, mcu/host communication, temperature reading, endstop
checking) in any real-world usage.

In general, the pins for the benchmark tests are chosen to flash LEDs
or other innocuous pins. **Always verify that it is safe to drive the
configured pins prior to running a benchmark.** It is not recommended
to drive an actual stepper during a benchmark.

## Step rate benchmark test ##

The test is performed using the console.py tool (described above). The
micro-controller is configured for the particular hardware platform
(see below) and then the following is cut-and-paste into the
console.py terminal window:
```
SET start_clock {clock+freq}
SET ticks 1000

reset_step_clock oid=0 clock={start_clock}
set_next_step_dir oid=0 dir=0
queue_step oid=0 interval={ticks} count=60000 add=0
set_next_step_dir oid=0 dir=1
queue_step oid=0 interval=3000 count=1 add=0

reset_step_clock oid=1 clock={start_clock}
set_next_step_dir oid=1 dir=0
queue_step oid=1 interval={ticks} count=60000 add=0
set_next_step_dir oid=1 dir=1
queue_step oid=1 interval=3000 count=1 add=0

reset_step_clock oid=2 clock={start_clock}
set_next_step_dir oid=2 dir=0
queue_step oid=2 interval={ticks} count=60000 add=0
set_next_step_dir oid=2 dir=1
queue_step oid=2 interval=3000 count=1 add=0
```

The above tests three steppers simultaneously stepping. If running the
above results in a "Rescheduled timer in the past" or "Stepper too far
in past" error then it indicates the `ticks` parameter is too low (it
results in a stepping rate that is too fast). The goal is to find the
lowest setting of the ticks parameter that reliably results in a
successful completion of the test. It should be possible to bisect the
ticks parameter until a stable value is found.

On a failure, one can copy-and-paste the following to clear the error
in preparation for the next test:
```
clear_shutdown
```

To obtain the single stepper and dual stepper benchmarks, the same
configuration sequence is used, but only the first block (for the
single stepper case) or first two blocks (for the dual stepper case)
of the above test is cut-and-paste into the console.py window.

To produce the benchmarks found in the Features.md document, the total
number of steps per second is calculated by multiplying the number of
active steppers with the nominal mcu frequency and dividing by the
final ticks parameter. The results are rounded to the nearest K. For
example, with three active steppers:
```
ECHO Test result is: {"%.0fK" % (3. * freq / ticks / 1000.)}
```

Host Benchmarks
===============

It is possible to run timing tests on the host software using the
"batch mode" processing mechanism described above. This is typically
done by choosing a large and complex G-Code file and timing how long
it takes for the host software to process it. For example:
```
time ~/klippy-env/bin/python ./klippy/klippy.py config/example.cfg -i something_complex.gcode -o /dev/null -d out/klipper.dict
```
